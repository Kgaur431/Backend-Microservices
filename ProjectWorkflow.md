#### Continuation 

```
        we have added "implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security'" this in build.gradle file 
            because if we want to use JWT token then we need to add this dependency 
            
            1.  we added the about package to add the about controller. 
            2.  we added the Application.yaml file to define the server and all.
            3.  we added the security package to add the appsecurityconfig class.
                 3.1    appsecurityconfig class extends the websecurityconfigureadapter class.
