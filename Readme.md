``` 
    if we hit the localhost:4343/about then it should show the about page but it is showing the default login page
        QUES:-  Why does it do that ?
        Ans :-  because spring security by default it makes every page secured of my app. 
             
        QUES:-  Why we need that web security configure adapter ?
        Ans :-  Because if Spring Security is enabled then it makes every page secured by default & we might don't want that 
                so we need to configure it.
